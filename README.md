## Research Questions addressed in the project

Our group worked on 3 major lines of inquiry with differing levels of perspective:

## 1) At a high level,we tried to understand the data in terms of ad volume by the two parties, type of messages and what these messages said.
a. We did a comparison of ad volume in each of the battleground states
b. Which candidate aired the most ads in a state and whether that had a correlation with
the final outcome?
c. What was the mix of positive and negative ads at the state level by both parties?
d. What were the key topics mentioned in these ads?

## 2) State by State Time Series Analysis â€“ Combine Dataset with RCP State Poll of Polls Data
a. We looked at the evolution over time of ad volume and message mix (% negative ads) in response to shifts in poll data in each state. This was done to get some insights into the ad strategy adopted by both parties and how it changed over time.
b. We looked at evolution of who sponsored the ads and what type of message those sponsors conveyed in their ads.
  
## 3) At the opposite end of the spectrum, we looked at individual ad level data by taking advantage of the fact that each ad in the archive has a unique ID, to analyze the following:
a. Which ads were featured most by each candidate? What made these ads more frequently aired in comparison to other ads?
b. How unique ads were aired in different markets? How did airings of unique ads evolve throughout the campaign?
c. We also analyzed whether ads being fact-checked mattered by leveraging the fact- check grade data provided by the archive.
